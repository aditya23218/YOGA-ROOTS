        <i>Sirsasana, also known as the Headstand pose, is an advanced yoga posture where the body is balanced on the
          head,
          supported by the forearms and hands. It offers benefits like improved circulation, upper body strength,
          balance,
          focus, and stress relief. Beginners should approach with caution and practice under supervision due to its
          complexity and potential risks.</i>

        <i>Sarvangasana, the Sanskrit name for the Shoulderstand, comes from the word “sarvanga”, meaning all parts.
          This
          asana strengthens the entire body; it gives many of the benefits of the Headstand, but here the circulation is
          directed to the thyroid gland instead of the head. The thyroid is an important gland of the endocrine system
          and
          this exercise gives it a rich supply of blood, improving and balancing the metabolism of literally every cell
          in
          the body. Other benefits of this posture includes stimulating cheerfulness, promoting clear thinking, and
          helping
          to cure depression</i>

        The Forward Bend looks, and is, simple – provided we relax into the position, rather than forcing ourselves into
        it. In a world where exertion is often rewarded, this pose is one of the most powerful and important asanas in
        teaching us the benefits of working with life as it is. This pose can be very meditative. It encourages
        conscious
        letting go by allowing gravity to pull the spine into the pose. As an added bonus, regular practice of
        Pascimothanasana also helps to counter the typical postural problems developed working a desk job by keeping the
        spine supple, the joints mobile, the internal organs toned, and the nervous system invigorated.

    <div class="flex px-[50px]">
      <div class="text-3xl ml-10 mr-10 flex items-center" >
        The Bow works all parts of your back simultaneously, increasing suppleness in the spine and hips. In this asana,
        our head, chest, and legs are lifted, while our body rests on our abdomen. The pose is so named because as we
        hold it, our body is bent back like a bow and our arms are held straight and taut like a bowstring. Dhanurasana
        combines and enhances the benefits of both the Cobra and the Locust. The whole body rests on the abdomen, giving
        a good massage to the abdominal region, especially the digestive organs. Swing, rock, and rejoice. Mentally
        repeat Oṃ, Oṃ, Oṃ.</div>
